<b>Introduction:</b>\r
</p>\r
<p>\r
The Assessment Centre\
    \ process was designed to capture many of the important characteristics of the\
    \ role and focused on the behaviors most applicable to your performance. The scenarios\
    \ provided to you were neutral in nature to ensure a level playing ground for\
    \ all participants. The inputs were gathered from various exercises like solving\
    \ online business simulations along with case studies and psychometric assessments.\
    \ This feedback report focuses on the overall performance in the online tasks\
    \ presented, rather than on \"right or wrong\" responses to the situations.</p>\r\
    
<p>\r
<b>Report Content:</b>\r
</p>\r
<p>\r
This report contains feedback\
    \ on your performance on several exercises including Psychometric Assessment,\
    \ Situational Judgement Test, Business Simulations, Competency Based Interview\
    \ and Business Case Study. The reports showcases score descriptions along with\
    \ your strengths and areas of improvements on competencies identified for superior\
    \ performance that are imperative for success.\r
